:rocket: Installation
---
1. Clone the Github repository to a desired location on your computer. You will need [git](https://git-scm.com/) to be preinstalled on your machine. Once the repository is cloned, you will then ```cd``` into the local repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/MeryHarikaG/slash-phase5.git
```
2. This project uses Python 3, so make sure that [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) are preinstalled. All requirements of the project are listed in the ```requirements.txt``` file. Use pip to install all of those.
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
3. To run this project, you must install PostgreSQL on your system. If you haven't already installed it, you can download the latest version of PostgreSQL from the official website: [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

### Configuring Database Connection

Once you've installed PostgreSQL, follow these steps to set up the database connection in your project:

i. Open the database.py file in your project directory.

ii. Locate the top section of the code where you define the database connection settings. It might look something like this:

   ```
   username = 'postgres'
   password = 'pass'
   ```
Replace username and password value from 'postgres', 'pass' with your PostgreSQL username password, respectively.

4. Once all the requirements are installed, you will have to ```cd``` into the ```src``` folder. Once in the ```src``` folder, use the python command to run the ```main.py``` file. (/MeryHarikaG/slash-phase5/src => you should be at this level)
```
cd src

For Mac
python3 main.py

For Windows
python main.py
```
5. While the above is running, go to new terminal and run streamlit application. Firstly go up one directory level using ```cd ..``` and use the following command:  (/MeryHarikaG/slash-phase5 => you should be at this level)
```
For Mac
python3 -m streamlit run slash_user_interface.py

For Windows
streamlit run slash_user_interface.py
```

:bulb: Use Case
---
* ***Students***: Students coming to university are generally on a budget and time constraint and generally spend hours wasting time to search for products on Websites. Slash is the perfect tool for these students that slashes all the unnecessary details on a website and helps them get prices for a product across multiple websites.Make the most of this tool in the upcoming Black Friday Sale.
* ***Data Analysts***: Finding data for any project is one of the most tedious job for a data analyst, and the datasets found might not be the most recent one. Using slash, they can create their own dataset in real time and format it as per their needs so that they can focus on what is actually inportant.

:page_facing_up: Why
---
- In a market where we are spoilt for choices, we often look for the best deals.  
- The ubiquity of internet access has leveled the retail playing field, making it easy for individuals and businesses to sell products without geographic limitation. In 2020, U.S. e-commerce sales, receiving a boost due to the COVID-19 pandemic, grew 44% and represented more than 21% of total retail sales, according to e-commerce information source Internet Retailer.
- The growth of e-commerce has not only changed the way customers shop, but also their expectations of how brands approach customer service, personalize communications, and provide customers choices.
- E-commerce market has prompted cut throat competition amongst dealers, which is discernable through the price patterns for products of major market players. Price cuts are somewhat of a norm now and getting the best deal for your money can sometimes be a hassle (even while online shopping).
- This is what Slash aims to reduce by giving you an easy to use, all in one place solution for finding the best deals for your products that major market dealers have to offer!
- Slash in its current form is for students who wish to get the best deals out of every e-commerce site and can be used by anyone who is willing to develop an application that consumes these web APIs.
- Future scope includes anything from a web application with a frontend or any Android or IOS application that utilises these Web APIs at their backend. Anyone can build their own custom application on top of these web APIs.
