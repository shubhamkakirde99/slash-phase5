# Slash Phase 5 Improvements
Following are the improvements made in the phase 5 of the project:

## Price Filtering
**Phase 5** : In the phase 5, we have added a price filtering feature that allows users to specify a minimum and maximum price range for their product searches. The Users can now refine their search results by setting price limits, ensuring they see only products within their budget. <br>

## Price-Based Sorting
**Phase 5** : In the phase 5, a new sorting feature has been integrated, enabling users to sort products based on their price, from the cheapest to the most expensive. This feature enhances the usability of the search function, allowing users to quickly find products that match their price preferences. <br>

## Highlighting the Cheapest Product
**Phase 5** : In the phase 5, to aid users in quickly identifying the most affordable options, the cheapest product in any search or filter result is now highlighted. This visual cue helps users easily locate the best deals without having to manually compare prices. <br>

## Integrated user-based wishlist Feature
**Phase 3** : Phase 3, users had no means to save their preferred search results, necessitating manual searches, reducing the usability of the application. <br>
**Phase 4** : In Phase 4, we introduced the ability for users to save specific search results upon login, enhancing usability by providing easy access through the wishlist feature.<br>
**Phase 5** : In the phase 5, we gave instructions on how users can access the feature properly by loggin in first and then adding products to the wishlist. We addressed and resolved previously identified bugs in the wishlist and registration pages. Users can now seamlessly add or remove items from their wishlist without encountering errors, and the registration process has been optimized for better reliability and user feedback. <br>

## Wishlist page Enhancements**
**Phase 5** : In the phase 5, most recently added item to wishlist is highlighted and list is displayed based on time of the addition of item to wishlist. Recently added items are displayed first on the list. 

## Integrated user-based login feature
**Phase 3** : In the phase 3, user login functionality was not available, which made users unable to save thier search.<br>
**Phase 4** : In the phase 4, we introduced user-based login functionality powered by PostgreSQL and JWT, allowing users to securely log in and enhance their product searching experience.<br>
**Phase 5** : In the phase 5, we have enhanced the login feature by giving warning meassages wherever required, to inform the users to use their account accessibilities properly. <br>

## Updated UI
**Phase 3** : In the phase 3, the user interface was basic and lacked the features to provide an optimal user experience when using the application. <br>
**Phase 4** : In the phase 4, significant enhancements were made to the user interface, resulting in an improved user experience. Features like a sidebar and dedicated pages for various functionalities were introduced, including a robust user-based wishlist feature. <br>
**Phase 5** : In the phase 5, we made significant changes in the user interface for the user to have better experience understanding and access the pre-existing and new features effectively. Improvements include streamlined navigation, responsive design elements, and a more cohesive color scheme and typography, enhancing overall user interaction with the application.

## Download CSV
**Phase 3** : In Phase 3, the application lacked a feature that allowed users to download a copy of their search results. <br>
**Phase 4** : In phase 4, a new method was implemented to enable users to download their search results in CSV format, enhancing the utility of the application.<br>

## Currency Convertor
**Phase 3** : In Phase 3, the application was constrained to displaying results exclusively in USD, which limited its versatility. <br>
**Phase 4** : In phase 4, we introduced a method that allows users to choose the currency in which they prefer to view the results. This enhances the application's flexibility and usability.<br>

## Database added
**Phase 3** : In Phase 3, the application lacked a database to store or retrieve any user-related information.<br>
**Phase 4** : In phase 4,  we integrated a PostgreSQL database, which enables the login and wishlist functionalities within the application.<br>
